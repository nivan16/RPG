# JavaScript Proposal - Gumbi's Journey

Javascript Proposal- Gumbi's Journey

This Javascript app is designed as a 2D rpg style game!
Similar to Legend of Zelda games of the past, it is graphically
a 2D dropdown view of the game world and characters. Additionally,
there is basic combat (press space to attack), items, and armor!

# # Functionality & MVPs # #

In Gumbi's Journey, users will be able to:

Experience a story!
Traverse levels with 'wasd'!
Have simple combat against enemies
Find items around the levels (hidden and visible)

## Technologies, Libraries, APIs
Canvas API for rendering/displaying 2D elements
Webpack to bundle the source JS script
NPM to manage project dependencies

## WireFrame

## Implementation Timeline

  * Friday Afternoon & Weekend: Read more thoroughly the documentation of Webpack and Canvas. Design out the level choices, item designs, character             designs, and textboxes that generate on user interaction. 
      Implement the basic movement patterns of the character and npcs(hostile), and tying user input to the movement of the character.

  * Monday: Implement the spawning/despawning of npcs on screen, also how to create a map that a character can travel through!

  * Tuesday: Implement the basic combat, for both the character and the npcs!

  * Wednesday: Add ability to "interact" with npcs, through text boxes that appear on screen at
      the action of user interaction key (probably will be 'e'!). Also will be adding the graphics to canvas!

  * Thursday Morning: Deploy to GitHub pages, and definitely rewrite this README as a production one!
